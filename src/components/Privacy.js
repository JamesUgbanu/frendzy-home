            Services, or those with an API or service with which we integrate.
            b.           We may disclose Your Information: i)             To any
            person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive
            Your Information as your agent, including as a result of your
            business dealings with that person (for example, your attorney);
            ii)           To our third-party vendors and service providers so
            that they may provide support for our internal and business
            operations, including for the processing of payments, handling of
            data processing, data verification, data storage, surveys, research,
            internal marketing, delivery of promotional, marketing and
            transaction materials, and maintenance of our Services and security.
            These companies are authorized to use Your Information only as
            necessary to provide these services to us and are contractually
            obligated to keep Your Information confidential; iii)         To
            third parties when you engage in certain activities through our
            Services that are sponsored by them, such as purchasing products or
            services offered by a third party, electing to receive information
            or communications from a third party, or electing to participate in
            contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored, in whole
            or in part, by a third party. When we disclose Your Information to
            these third parties, Your Information will become subject to the
            information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the
            third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with
            respect to its use and further sharing of Your Information;
            iv)         As required by law or ordered by a court, regulatory, or
            administrative agency; v)           As we deem necessary, in our
            sole discretion, if we believe that you are violating any applicable
            law, rule or regulation, or are otherwise interfering with
            another&#39;s rights or property, including, without limitation, our
            rights or property; vi)         If requested by authorities in the
            event of any act of terrorism or instance of local, regional or
            national emergency; vii)       To enforce our Terms of Service, this
            Privacy Policy, and any other applicable agreements and policies;
            viii)     To enforce or protect our rights. c.   We will only
            transfer data outside of the EU to countries that offer an
            appropriate level of data protection. 16.       Law Enforcement
            a.           Frendzy is committed to cooperating with law
            enforcement while respecting each individual’s right to privacy. If
            Frendzy receives a request for user account information from a
            government agency investigating criminal activity, we will review
            the request to be certain that it satisfies all legal requirements
            before releasing information to the requesting agency. b.          
            Furthermore, under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2702(b)(8) and 2702(c)(4) (Voluntary
            Disclosure Of Customer Communications or Records), Frendzy may
            disclose user account information to law enforcement, without a
            subpoena, court order, or search warrant, in response to a valid
            emergency when we believe that doing so is necessary to prevent
            death or serious physical harm to someone. Frendzy will not release
            more information than it prudently believes is necessary to prevent
            harm in an emergency situation. 17.       Other Sharing We may share
            your information as follows: a.          With Frendzy subsidiaries
            and affiliated entities that provide services or conduct data
            processing on our behalf, or for data verification, data
            centralization and/or logistics purposes; b.           With
            affiliated entities that provide payment processing services on our
            behalf;   c.            With vendors, consultants, marketing
            partners, and other service providers who need access to such
            information to carry out work on our behalf; d.           In
            response to a request for information by a competent authority if we
            believe disclosure is in accordance with, or is otherwise required
            by, any applicable law, regulation, or legal process; e.          
            With law enforcement officials, government authorities, or other
            third parties if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our
            user agreements, Terms of Service, or policies, or to protect the
            rights, property, or safety of Frendzy or others; f.             In
            connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of
            company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or
            acquisition of all or a portion of our business by or into another
            company; g.           If we otherwise notify you and you consent to
            the sharing; and h.           In an aggregated and/or anonymized
            form which cannot reasonably be used to identify you. 18.      
            Social Sharing Features a.           Our Services may now or in the
            future integrate with social sharing features and other related
            tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with
            other Apps, sites, or media, and vice versa. Your use of such
            features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the
            public, depending on the settings you establish with the social
            sharing service. Please refer to the privacy policies of those
            social sharing services for more information about how they handle
            the data you provide to or share through them. b.           Any
            information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting
            publicly to our Services or the social sharing service becomes
            available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy
            settings that you set within the social sharing service. Once you
            have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be
            re-shared by others. If you remove information that you posted to
            our Services or the social sharing service, copies may still remain
            viewable in cached and archived pages, or if other users or third
            parties, using our Services or the social sharing service, have
            re-shared, copied or saved that User Content. 19.       Analytics
            and Advertising Services Provided By Others We may allow others to
            provide audience measurement and analytics services for us, to serve
            advertisements on our behalf across the Internet, and to track and
            report on the performance of those advertisements. These entities
            may use cookies, web beacons, software development kits (SDKs), and
            other technologies to identify your device when you visit our Site
            and use our Services, as well as when you visit other online sites
            and services. 20.       Links to Third Party Websites a.          
            Our Services, as well as the email messages sent with respect to our
            Services, may contain links or access to websites operated by third
            parties that are beyond our control. Links or access to third
            parties from our Services are not an endorsement by us of such third
            parties, or their websites, applications, products, services, or
            practices. We are not responsible for the privacy policy, terms and
            conditions, practices or the content of such third parties. These
            third parties may send their own cookies to you and independently
            collect data. b.           If you visit or access a third-party
            Website, application or other property that is linked or accessed
            from our Services, we encourage you to read any privacy policies and
            terms and conditions of that third party before providing any
            personally identifiable information. If you have a question about
            the terms and conditions, privacy policy, practices or contents of a
            third party, please contact the third party directly. 21.       Do
            Not Track Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a
            &quot;do not track&quot; feature that sends signals to the websites
            you visit, indicating that you do not want your online activities
            tracked. This is different than blocking or deleting cookies, as
            browsers with a &quot;do not track&quot; feature enabled may still
            accept cookies. There is currently no industry standard for how
            companies should respond to &quot;do not track&quot; signals,
            although one may develop in the future. We do not respond to
            &quot;do not track&quot; signals at this time; if we do so in the
            future, we will describe how in this Privacy Policy. 22.      
            International Privacy Practices In order to provide our products and
            services to you, we may send and store your personal information
            outside of the country where you reside or are located, including to
            the United States. Accordingly, if you reside or are located outside
            of the United States, your personal information may be transferred
            outside of the country where you reside or are located, including
            countries that may not, or do not, provide the same level of
            protection for your personal information. We are committed to
            protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information
            when it is transferred. If you reside or are located within the
            European Economic Area and such transfers occur, we take appropriate
            steps to provide the same level of protection for the processing
            carried out in any such countries as you would have within the
            European Economic Area to the extent feasible under applicable law.
            By using and accessing our products and services, users who reside
            or are located in countries outside of the United States agree and
            consent to the transfer to and processing of personal information on
            servers located outside of the country where they reside, and that
            the protection of such information may be different than required
            under the laws of their residence or location. 23.       Account
            Information You may correct your account information at any time by
            logging into your online account and selecting the deletion option.
            Please note that in some cases we may retain certain information
            about you as required by law, or for legitimate business purposes to
            the extent permitted by law. For instance, if you have a standing
            credit or debit on your account, or if we believe you have committed
            fraud or violated our Terms of Service, we may seek to resolve the
            issue before deleting your information. Your Preferences 24.      
            Access Rights Frendzy will comply with individuals’ requests
            regarding access, correction, and/or deletion of the personal data
            it stores in accordance with applicable law. To make changes to your
            account affecting your personal information, please login to your
            online account and select app settings / profile settings. At any
            time, upon request, Frendzy will provide you with access to your
            data and how it is being used, and can deliver your data to you or a
            requested third-party. If you wish to exercise this right please
            contact hello@frendzy.app. 25.                   Promotional
            Information Opt Out You may opt out of receiving promotional
            messages from us by following the instructions in those messages. If
            you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications
            regarding your account, about Services you have requested, or about
            our ongoing business relations. 26.                   Changes to the
            Privacy Policy We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.
            If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will inform you by
            posting the revised Privacy Policy on the Site. Those changes will
            go into effect on the &quot;Last updated&quot; date shown below. By
            continuing to use the Site or Services, you consent to the revised
            Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically review the Privacy
            Policy for the latest information on our privacy practices.
